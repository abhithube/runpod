A script to set up ComfyUI and some custom nodes on Runpod. I'm not interesting in building custom Docker images, so this script is meant to override the start command of a Runpod base image. I'm using `runpod/base:0.7.0-ubuntu2404-cuda1290`. My ComfyUI installation and models are stored on a network volume, and attached to each new pod. On startup, ComfyUI is copied over to the container volume. I've only selected custom nodes that I care about, so you'll have to modify the CUSTOM_NODES variable in the script as necessary for your use cases.
